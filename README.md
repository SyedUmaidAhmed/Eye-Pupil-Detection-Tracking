# Eye-Pupil-Detection-Tracking
This will track the postions and movement of eyes in three directions forward, right & left

This project requires dlib to be installed on your PC with python programming language.

Also download file "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat" from somewhere as it is required. It is greater in size that's why I haven't uploaded on my repository.

The real file is tyu.py

If it doesn't work properly on your PC, kindly try Testing.py files
